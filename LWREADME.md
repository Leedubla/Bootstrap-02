Hello! 

The following is what changes I made to the BootStrap inputs.

Here are the edits that will appear on all pages.

All pages were linked to the following:

I made edits at 02:41, I know it was after the assignment was due but I could not sleep knowing that my footer was not finished. I am so sorry that it was pushed back. I understand if this will dock my grade down.

The edits done on each page and on the index.css are the following.

I made an id tag of "footer" and linked it to css. In css I made editions like position fixed and bottom 0, that way it wont move off the bottom.
